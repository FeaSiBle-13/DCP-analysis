#saddlepoint_assignment_graph
An assignment_graph.in file is required. It needs to contain a line with 'category:' followed by the barriers which should be shown as bars in the bar diagram. As seperator a space is used. A line with 'label:' is required where the categories are named. If several categories are accorded to one bar (so the same label) just label the categories in line label with the same name.
